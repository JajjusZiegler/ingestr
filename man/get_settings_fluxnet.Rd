\arguments{
\item{dir_hh}{A character string specifying the local path of
half-hourly FLUXNET data, required to get daytime VPD. Defaults to
\code{"."} (present working directory).}

\item{dir_hr}{A character string specifying the local path of
hourly FLUXNET data, required to get daytime VPD. Defaults to
\code{"."} (present working directory).}

\item{getswc}{If \code{getswc==TRUE}, then all soil water content data
(variables starting with \code{"SWC_"}) are read. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{threshold_GPP}{A numeric value (between 0 and 1 for daily, weekly,
monthly, and annual data or 0 [measured], 1 [good quality gapfill], 2 [
medium], 3 [poor] for half-hourly data). The value specifies the
threshold for excluding data during data cleaning. The threshold is
with respect to the data quality flag in the FLUXNET data, indicating
the fraction of measured and good quality gapfilled data for daily, weekly,
monthly, and annual data and 0 [measured], 1 [good quality gapfill], 2 [
medium], 3 [poor] for half-hourly data. Defaults to \code{threshold_GPP=0}
meaning no data is excluded.}

\item{threshold_LE}{A numeric value (between 0 and 1 for daily, weekly,
monthly, and annual data or 0 [measured], 1 [good quality gapfill], 2 [
medium], 3 [poor] for half-hourly data). The value specifies the
threshold for excluding data during data cleaning. The threshold is
with respect to the data quality flag in the FLUXNET data, indicating
the fraction of measured and good quality gapfilled data for daily, weekly,
monthly, and annual data and 0 [measured], 1 [good quality gapfill], 2 [
medium], 3 [poor] for half-hourly data. Defaults to \code{threshold_GPP=0}
meaning no data is excluded.}

\item{threshold_H}{A numeric value (between 0 and 1 for daily, weekly,
monthly, and annual data or 0 [measured], 1 [good quality gapfill], 2 [
medium], 3 [poor] for half-hourly data). The value specifies the
threshold for excluding data during data cleaning. The threshold is
with respect to the data quality flag in the FLUXNET data, indicating
the fraction of measured and good quality gapfilled data for daily, weekly,
monthly, and annual data and 0 [measured], 1 [good quality gapfill], 2 [
medium], 3 [poor] for half-hourly data. Defaults to \code{threshold_GPP=0}
meaning no data is excluded.}

\item{threshold_SWC}{A numeric value (between 0 and 1 for daily, weekly,
monthly, and annual data or 0 [measured], 1 [good quality gapfill], 2 [
medium], 3 [poor] for half-hourly data). The value specifies the
threshold for excluding data during data cleaning. The threshold is
with respect to the data quality flag in the FLUXNET data, indicating
the fraction of measured and good quality gapfilled data for daily, weekly,
monthly, and annual data and 0 [measured], 1 [good quality gapfill], 2 [
medium], 3 [poor] for half-hourly data. Defaults to \code{threshold_GPP=0}
meaning no data is excluded.}

\item{threshold_WS}{A numeric value (between 0 and 1 for daily, weekly,
monthly, and annual data or 0 [measured], 1 [good quality gapfill], 2 [
medium], 3 [poor] for half-hourly data). The value specifies the
threshold for excluding data during data cleaning. The threshold is
with respect to the data quality flag in the FLUXNET data, indicating
the fraction of measured and good quality gapfilled data for daily, weekly,
monthly, and annual data and 0 [measured], 1 [good quality gapfill], 2 [
medium], 3 [poor] for half-hourly data. Defaults to \code{threshold_GPP=0}
meaning no data is excluded.}

\item{threshold_USTAR}{A numeric value (between 0 and 1 for daily, weekly,
monthly, and annual data or 0 [measured], 1 [good quality gapfill], 2 [
medium], 3 [poor] for half-hourly data). The value specifies the
threshold for excluding data during data cleaning. The threshold is
with respect to the data quality flag in the FLUXNET data, indicating
the fraction of measured and good quality gapfilled data for daily, weekly,
monthly, and annual data and 0 [measured], 1 [good quality gapfill], 2 [
medium], 3 [poor] for half-hourly data. Defaults to \code{threshold_GPP=0}
meaning no data is excluded.}

\item{threshold_T}{A numeric value (between 0 and 1 for daily, weekly,
monthly, and annual data or 0 [measured], 1 [good quality gapfill], 2 [
medium], 3 [poor] for half-hourly data). The value specifies the
threshold for excluding data during data cleaning. The threshold is
with respect to the data quality flag in the FLUXNET data, indicating
the fraction of measured and good quality gapfilled data for daily, weekly,
monthly, and annual data and 0 [measured], 1 [good quality gapfill], 2 [

medium], 3 [poor] for half-hourly data). The value specifies the
threshold for excluding data during data cleaning. The threshold is
with respect to the data quality flag in the FLUXNET data, indicating
the fraction of measured and good quality gapfilled data for daily, weekly,
monthly, and annual data and 0 [measured], 1 [good quality gapfill], 2 [
medium], 3 [poor] for half-hourly data. Defaults to \code{threshold_GPP=0}
meaning no data is excluded.}

\item{filter_ntdt}{A logical specifying whether agreement of daytime 
and nighttime based GPP estimates is to be used as a filter. 
Data points are removed where their difference is below the the 97.5% and 
above the 2.5% quantile of all difference values per site.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{return_qc}{A logical specifying whether quality control variables
should be returned. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{remove_neg}{A logical specifying whether negative GPP values are to
be removed (replaces with NA). Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
